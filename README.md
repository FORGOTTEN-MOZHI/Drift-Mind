# 🌊 Drift Mind

**Drift Mind** is a Godot-powered interactive experience designed for the AI Gen Exchange Hackathon. It offers a calming, ocean-themed journey through emotional reflection and gentle motivation.

## 🎮 How It Works

- **Scene 1**: A "Begin" button starts the experience.
- **Scene 2**: The user is asked, _"Are you facing any emotional drawbacks or something?"_
  - If **No**, the app returns to the original scene.
  - If **Yes**, it continues to the next prompt.
- **Scene 3**: _"Are you worried about what others think of you?"_
  - If **No**, the app explores other emotional challenges.
  - If **Yes**, it dives deeper into this concern and offers motivational support through scene transitions and affirmations.

Each path is designed to guide the user toward self-awareness and emotional clarity.
